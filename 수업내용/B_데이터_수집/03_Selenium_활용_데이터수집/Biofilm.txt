Biofilm formation of microorganisms increases resistance to common antibiotics and antifungal agents. Therefore, the inhibition of biofilm depends on the effective treatment of microbial infections, including C.albicans, for the treat duration and economic efficiency of patients. Nano-particle and essential oil are well known for their antifungal subsistence. In addition, physical therapy using ultrasound is also provided to remove biofilm. The purpose of this study is how to suppress efficient biofilm by measuring the biological activity of C.albicans and the synergy effect using antifungal substances, nanoparticles, and HIFU. Cell viability was quantified and evaluated using XTT reduction assay. AuNPs and AgNPs were used to measure the effect of nanoparticles. hinokitiol and thymol were used to measure the effect of essential oil. HIFU was used as an ultrasound to measure the synergy effect of each substance. Mature biofilm was cultured for 24 hours and mature biofilm was cultured for 48 hours to treat with nanoparticle, antifungal substance, and HIFU, and the formation of biofilm was found to increase resistance to antifungal effects. The combination of Antifungal and Nanoparticles with HIFU has been shown to be the most effective way to suppress biofilm. The combined treatment effect was confirmed by SEM. In conclusion, the combination of antifungal and nanoparticles with HIFU indicates that it has the potential and efficiency of treatment.
C. albicans belonging to the normal flora is a harmless microorganism [1]. However, microbiological changes and weakening of the immune response lead to C. albicans in-fection, which is the cause of C. albicans disease [2]. C. albicans infection occurs in an indwelling medical device, such as a catether, leading to a bloodstream infection. Alt-hough C. albicans is a harmless microorganism, it forms biofilms and belongs to one of the fungus causing infections [3]. A biofilm is a group of adherent cells surrounded by an extracellular polymeric substance matrix (EPS) [4]. EPS is a survival device for microor-ganisms to protect themselves from the outside in difficult environments [5]. Therefore, biofilm helps to have high resistance to antifungal substance effect [6]. In conclusion, we suggest the importance of novel therapies other than antifungal substances such as flu-conazole or amphotericin B [7].
The antifungal effect of nanoparticles [8], peptides [9], and essential [10], corre-sponding to various types of chemical substances, and ultrasound [11], corresponding to physical shock therapy, were studied. Nanoparticles are currently being studied as one of the materials for antifungal effect. AuNPs and AgNPs have been widely studied as antifungal substances among nanoparticles [12,13]. A recent study of nanoparticles on C. albicans revealed that the effect of nanoparticles induces microstructural changes in cells and biofilms [14,15].
 Essential oil is emerging as a new subtance of Antifungal. Essential oil is aromatic oily liquids extracted from plant materials [16]. Essential oil, known as a powerful anti-bacterial and antifungal substance, has been reported to have many effects [16]. Lami-aceae and Cupressaceae, which contain essential oil, are among the important plants [17]. In the Cupressaceae family, hinokitiol is well known as a representative tropolne [18]. Derived from the Lamiaceae family, thymol is a monoterpenoid compound [19]. As es-sential oils for biological activities, hinokitiol and thymol are well known.
 In addition to chemical treatment methods, physical treatment methods may be used to remove biofilm. Biofilm-linked infections that share high resistance to non-invasive treatments such as antifungal substances require physical therapy [20]. Ul-trasound has been used as a physical therapy for many years as a method to remove biofilms without damaging human cells [20]. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is one of the therapeutic ultrasounds that deliver focused ultrasound [21]. It anatomically designates solid tumors, making it a flexible and efficient tool for clinical research as a vehicle to heat weak local tissues and deliver drugs [22]. Although research on HIFU is active now, in the past, it was focused on the application of low intensity focused ultra-sound (LIFU) or sonicar [23]. However, ultrasound studies for biofilm inhibition suggest a longer study period [24]. Therefore, this study aims to study the synergy effect of an-tifungal substances and nanoparticles with HIFU on the mature biofilm of C. albicans.
